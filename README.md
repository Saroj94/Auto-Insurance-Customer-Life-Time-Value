# Auto-Insurance-Customer-Life-Time-Value

**Problem Description**

Forecasting is an important approach to take an optimal decision and implement appropriate action plans. A major non-life insurance company wants to evaluate customer life time value based on each customerâ€™s demographics and policy information including claim details. The CLV is a profitability metric in terms of a value placed by the company on each customer and can be conceived in two dimensions: the customer`s present Value and potential future Value.

You are expected to create an analytical and modelling framework to predict the life time value of each customer based on the quantitative and qualitative features provided in the dataset and also cluster the train dataset to understand behaviour of each segment.

What is customer lifetime value (CLV)? Customer lifetime value is the total amount of money a customer is expected to spend with your business, or on your products, during the lifetime of an average business relationship.
